                                        <p>Among other software QA services, we provide automation testing to replace
                                            manual work and enhance overall product quality, speed up time to market and
                                            reduce the QA costs. Automated tests run quickly, offer better test

                                        <p>Functional testing lets us analyze a separate part of the application within
                                            the context of the entire application. This testing ensures that the system
                                            does what users are expecting it to do.In other words, we test the business
                                            logic of a product to make sure all the functional objectives are met and
                                            the app or website performs the functionality it is supposed to.</p>

                                        <p>In a world of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), it is critical that your APIs work as expected for functionality, reliability, performance, security, and shows great performance, we need to conduct API testing.

                                        <h5>Load and Performance Testing:</h5>
                                        <p>- Load testing is executed to find out how many users can interact with the
                                            system simultaneously. In other words, it identifies the maximum number of
                                            users the app or website can handle.<br><br>- Performance testing includes
                                            various tests that are intended to check how the product behaves and
                                            performs.Those tests are written to examine stability, reliability, speed,
                                            and many other parameters.<br><br>If you want to focus on maximum user
                                            experience, you had to walk through performance testing. This approach will
                                            help our team to ensure that your app and servers have the highest level of
                                            performance, stability, and responsiveness.</p>

                                        <h5>Mobile App Testing</h5>
                                        <p>Mobile Apps are evolving fast, and hence need regular functional and
                                            regression testing. Since they work in an extremely diverse and
                                            unpredictable user environment, they need special attention to
                                            non-functional testing. We have a library of thousands of such test cases to
                                            ensure that you cover most scenarios.</p>

Our personal data should be treated as confidentially as possible. Security testing gives the user a trustworthy product, as problems and risks are identified in advance and eliminated during development.

Digital products should offer their users added value and support them in completing certain tasks faster, easier, and more efficiently. It is therefore very important that digital products actually and continuously deliver this added value – and ideally also after a new update, i.e. after a mostly comprehensive change to the software.

This is also the main reason why apps and software should be tested – to ensure the consistency of requirements over the entire product life cycle. Customer trust is not easy to earn, especially if the product has more bugs after new releases.
